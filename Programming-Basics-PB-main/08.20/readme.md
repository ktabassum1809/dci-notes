## Classes

- Classes are like Blueprints for creating objects
- A concept that actually isn't used very much in JavaScript
- However, it's still *very important* to know
- I would even say it's critical to know classes
    - Even if the benefits aren't immediately obvious

- Learning classes teaches important programming concepts
    - This prepares you for the future
    - It's VERY common that developers learn and use multiple languages
    - It's VERY common to start a job where you have to learn a new language
        - Many graduates start to work in Java, PHP, Ruby, Python...
        - Or at least will transition to them later
        - (In fact, I recommend applying for jobs like "PHP Developer" as well!)
    - Learning classes helps you prepare for all of this

### OOP

- Object Oriented Programming
- So far, we have been doing *procedural programming*
    - Now we will dip our toes into the water of OOP programming
    - It's not common to do OOP in JavaScript
    - Usually JS programming only partially follows OOP concepts, if at all

- In some languages almost everything is classes and objects (Java, C#)
    -  Single functions don't really exist, everything is a method

- In OOP, you divide your code into classes
- Classes are independent concepts in your code
- They can be equivalent to a real world thing, like `Product` or `User`
- They can be a functional part of your program, like `Logger` or `Config`

- Your Classes (User, Product) hold related data and methods

- Classes are actually like blueprints or templates
    - You make actual objects based on them
