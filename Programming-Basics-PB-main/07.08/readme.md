# PB - Program - 01: Loops

**Last week:**

- Conditionals
- Arrays

**TODAY**
- Loops 
- the `for` loop

## Loops

- It's extremely common to want to repeat a bit of code many many times
- This can be done using loops
- A loop is typically made of 3 parts
    - A starting point (initialization)
    - An ending point (exit condition)
    - A progress step

- A loop can repeat one thing; one statement
    - Or it can repeat a whole block of code

- A `for` loop makes a new block scope, similar to `if` statements
