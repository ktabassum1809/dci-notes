/*
Slice

With slice() we can get a portion (or slice) of a string.
A slice is a sequence of adjacent characters between 2 indexes

Important:
- the first index is inclusive
- the second index is exclusive
*/

const firstName = "sophia"
console.log(firstName.slice(1))

// We could get a string with only the first letter upper case
const capitalized = firstName[0].toUpperCase() + firstName.slice(1)
console.log(capitalized)

/*
Includes

With includes() we can check is a string contains another string
The response will be a boolean: true or false
*/

const greeting = "Greetings earthlings! We Come In Peace!";
console.log(`Is Peace included? ${greeting.includes("Peace")}`)
console.log(`Is peace included? ${greeting.includes("peace")}`)

// Sometimes when examining strings, the case could be ignored
const lowercased = greeting.toLowerCase()
console.log(`Is peace or Peace included? ${lowercased.includes("peace")}`)

/*
Trim

The method trim() creates a new string and removes spaces
at the beginning and at the end.
