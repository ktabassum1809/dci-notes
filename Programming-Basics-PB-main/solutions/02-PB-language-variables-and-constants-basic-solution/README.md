# Basic Variables and Constants

Open each JavaScript file and follow the instructions inside.

The same instructions are listed below

## Task 1

Complete the code below so that in the console we see the number 11
 

```js
const x

// don't change this
console.log(x);
```

## Task 2
Fix the code below so that the output in the console is the number 5 

```js
x = 5;
let x;

// don't change this
console.log(x);
```

## Task 3
Fix the code below so that it works with the `let` keyword instead of `var`.
  
The variable should initially be declared with the value of `5` and then you should change its value to `7`.

  
The output in the console should then be `7`.
  
```js
var x = 5;
var x = 7;

// don't change this
console.log(x);
```

## Task 4

Fix the code below so that the first `console.log()` outputs `"Hello Jude"` and the second one `"Hey Jude"`

```js
const firstName = "Jude";
const greeting = "Hello";

console.log(greeting, firstName); // Hello Jude

greeting = "Hey";

console.log(greeting, firstName); // Hey Jude
```

## Task 5

Fix the code below so that the output in the console is `8`


```js
let x == 8;

// don't change this
console.log(x);
```

## Task 6

Fix the code below so that the output in the console is the string `"hello"`
 
```js
const greeting = hello;

// don't change this
console.log(greeting);
```

## Task 7

Fix the code below so that the output in the console is the string `'hello'`

```js
const greeting = "hello';

// don't change this
console.log(greeting);
```

## Task 8

Right now the output in the console is `"number"`. 

Change the code below so that the output is `"string"`.
 

```js
const x = 2;

// don't change this
console.log(typeof x)
```

## Task 9

Right now the output in the console is `"true"`.

Change the value of the variable `isLoggedIn` and the code inside the
`console.log()` so that the output is `"boolean"`


```js
let isLoggedIn = "true";

console.log(isLoggedIn);
```
