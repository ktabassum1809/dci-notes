# Naming Conventions

Look at the code below and change the variable names where necessary.

- each variable name should follow the `camel case` naming convention (read below for more details about it)
- each variable name should fit the value it's assigned to
 

```js
let first_name = "Rosa";
let LastName = "Dorsey";
let age = 27;
let asd = "New York";
let string = "27/04/1995";
let Is_married = false;
let FAVORITEFOOD = "pancakes";
let x = "cola";
```

## Camel case

When following the `camel case` naming convention, we write variable names in lower case.

For example: `name`, `number`, `city`, `year`.

If a variable name is made by more than one word, every word after the first one will be capitalised.

For example: `firstName`, `telephoneNumber`, `alternativeDeliveryAddress`
