## Task 3

Next to your bed, you have a pile of stuff to read, a mix of books and comics.

- They are organised in a JavaScript array
- the first element is the one at the bottom of the pile
- every night, you pick the one at the top and start reading it

Your task is to:

- print a message saying how many books you have left to read
- print a message with the next book you are going to read 
- remove the book you finished to read and then:
    - print a message with its title
    - print a message with the number of books left
    - print a message with the title of the next book

Repeat the last part 3 times.

Input array:

```javascript

const booksToRead = [
  "Heartstopper",

  "Ghost World",
  "Normal People",
  "One Piece vol. 102",
  "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy",
  "This One Summer",
];
