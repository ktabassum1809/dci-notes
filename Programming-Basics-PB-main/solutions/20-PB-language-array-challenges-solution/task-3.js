/*
Task 3

Next to your bed, you have a pile of stuff to read, a mix
of books and comics.

- They are organised in a JavaScript array
- the first element is the one at the bottom of the pile
- every night, you pick the one at the top and start reading it

Your task is to:

- print a message saying how many books you have left to read
- print a message with the next book you are going to read 
- remove the book you finished to read and then:
    - print a message with its title
    - print a message with the number of books left
    - print a message with the title of the next book

Repeat the last part 3 times

Expected output:

I have 8 books to read.
I'm starting with: "This One Summer"

I finished reading "This One Summer"
Now I have 7 books to read.
Next one is: "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"

I finished reading "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"
Now I have 6 books to read.
Next one is: "One Piece vol. 102"

I finished reading "One Piece vol. 102"
Now I have 5 books to read.
Next one is: "Normal People"
