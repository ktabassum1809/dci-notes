# Shallow cloning

## Task 1

Given an array of products called `cart` and a product object `hatProduct`:

```javascript
const cart = [
  {
    type: "t-shirt",
    price: 19,
    color: "green",
  },
  {
    type: "jeans",
    price: 27,
    color: "blue",
  }
];

const hatProduct = {
  type: "hat",
  price: 15,
  color: "pink",
};
```

Create a function called `addProduct` that takes the cart array and the hat product in input.

The function should add the new product at the end of the array and return the updated cart.

Make sure that the original cart is not modified. So, after calling the function, `cart` still has only 2 products and the function returns a new array with 3 products.

## Task 2

Given an array `tasks` containing a series of objects:

```javascript
const tasks = [
    {
        task: "clean apartment",
        priority: 5
    },
    {
        task: "learn objects",
        priority: 2
    },
    {
        task: "practice JavaScript",
        priority: 1
    }
]
```

Create a function called `finishTask` that:

- takes in input an array of tasks
- removes the last item from the array
- returns the updated array

The original task array must not be modified.

## Task 3

Given an object `person`:

```javascript
const person = {
    firstName: "James",
    lastName: "Ensor",
    age: 13
}
```

Create a function called `addFullName` that takes in input an object and adds a new property to it called `fullName`. 

The function returns the modified version of the object. The property should combine together `firstName` and `lastName`.

The original `person` object must not be changed.

## Task 4

Given an array of products create a function called `applyDiscount` that takes in input an array of products and a discount value, and applies the discount to all the products in the array.

The function then returns the array with the discounted prices.

The original array should not be modified.

Formula to calculate a discount:

```plaintext
discountedPrice = price - (price * discount / 100);

20% discount of 100€:
100 - (100 * 20 / 100) -> 100 - (200 / 100) -> 100 - 20 -> 80


15% discount of 70€:
70 - (70 * 15 / 100) -> 70 - (1050 / 100) -> 70 - 10.5 -> 59.5 
```

applyDiscount(products, 15) // expected:
