Write a program that asks the user to enter a number. The program will add together all the positive numbers entered and will stop at the first negative number.

For example:

```plaintext
Type any number to add: 1
Type any number to add: 2

Type any number to add: -1

The total is: 6
```

## Task 2

Write a program that asks the user to type an animal and it responds with the sound of that animal.

Let the user finish the program by typing `STOP`.

For example:

```plaintext
Enter an animal: cat
Meow

Enter an animal: dog
Woof! Woof!

Enter an animal: giraffe
Sorry, don't know that one

Enter an animal: STOP
```

## Task 3

Given an array with a series of greetings, write a program that asks the user to enter a name and responds greeting that name. The greeting should be picked randomly from the list.

Let the user type `STOP` to end the program.

```plaintext
let greetings = ["hi", "hello", "hola"];

Enter a name: Julia
hi, Julia

Enter a name: Max
hola, Max

Enter a name: STOP
```
