# Accumulator pattern

# Task 1

Use a loop to calculate the sum of the first 10 numbers and print the result to the console

Expected output: `55`


## Task 2 

Use a loop to create a string with the numbers from 0 to 9, then print it to the console

Expected output: `0123456789`

## Task 3

Use a loop to create a string with only the even numbers between 0 to 9, then print it to the console

Expected output: `02468` 

## Task 4

Use a loop to create an array containing the numbers from 0 to 100, then print the whole array to the console

Expected output: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..., 98, 99, 100]`


## Task 5
 
Use a loop to create an array containing the even numbers between 0 to 100, then print the whole array to the console
 
Expected output: `[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ..., 96, 98, 100]`
 
## Task 6

Use a loop to calculate the sum of the even numbers between 0 and 100 (including 100), the print the result to the console

Expected output: `2550`


## Task 7

Use a loop to calculate the sum of the odd numbers between 0 and 100 (including 100), the print the result to the console

Expected output: `2500`

## Task 8

Create an empty string and a loop that goes from 0 to 50.

Inside the loop, check if the current index is divisible by 2, 3 or 5:

- if it's divisible by 2, add a 2 to the string
- if it's divisible by 3, add a 3 to the string
- if it's divisible by 5, add a 5 to the string
- otherwise, add an underscore `_` to the string 

At the end, print the string to the console

Expected output: `2_23252_232_2_232_2_232_25232_2_23252_232_2_232_2_2`


## Task 9

Use a loop to create a string containing all numbers from 0 to 10, separated by a dash `-`

Expected output: `0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10`

## Task 10

Use a loop that goes from 0 to 10 and adds, multiplies every number by 2 and adds the result in an array. Print the array tot he console

Expected output: `[ 0,  2,  4,  6,  8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 ]`
