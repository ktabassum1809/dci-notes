# Object: create, access, update

This exercise is meant to let you properly understand and practice basic operations we perform with objects, tipically:

- creating objects
- accessing, reading, their properties
- updating, modifying, the values of these properties

## Task 1

Given the object below, change the value of the `read` property from `false` to `true`. Then, output the whole object to the console.

```javascript
const book = {
    title: "A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript",
    author: "Mark Myers",
    price: 19.95,
    read: false
};
```

Expected output:

```plaintext
const book = {
    title: "A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript",
    author: "Mark Myers",
    price: 19.95,
    read: read
};
```

## Task 2

Given the object below, increase the `age` property by 1. Then, output the whole object to the console.

```javascript
const person = {
    firstName: "Martha",
    lastName: "Martin",
    age: 27
};
```

Expected output:
```javascript
const person = {
    firstName: "Martha",
    lastName: "Martin",
    age: 28
};
```

## Task 3

Given the object below, modify the value of the property `discountedPrice` so that it's half of the `price` property. 

Then, output a message to the console as shown below.

```javascript
const product = {
    type: "hat",
    color: "green",
    brand: "Dolphin",
    price: 22,
    discountedPrice: 22,
};
```

**IMPORTANT**: when modifying `discountedPrice`, make sure to use the property `price` to calculate the new value, rather than typing `22` directly.

Expected output:

```plaintext
SALE: the green Dolphin hat costs now only 11€ instead of 22€!
```

## Task 4

Given the object below, add a new property to it called `fullName`.

The property should combine the values from `firstName` and `lastName`, separated by a space.


```javascript
const person = {
    firstName: "Jim",
    lastName: "Jameson",
    age: 37
};
```

Expected output:

```plaintext
const person = {
    firstName: "Jim",
    lastName: "Jameson",
    age: 37,
    fullName: "Jim Jameson"
};
```

## Task 5

Given the object below, modify the value of the property `city` so that the first letter is correctly capitalised.

```javascript
const person = {
    firstName: "Sylvia",
    lastName: "Sun",
    city: "london"
};
```

**IMPORTANT**: try to use and modify the current value of `city` rather than manually typing `London`. 

Expected output:

```plaintext
const person = {
    firstName: "Sylvia",
    lastName: "Sun",
    city: "London"
};
```
