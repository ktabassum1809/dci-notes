# Operators

## Tasks

### Task 1

You are doing some shopping.

Create 3 variables to represent price of 3 products, for example:

- jeansPrice
- shoesPrice
- hatPrice

Assign them to 3 numerical values and use them to calculate the total price.

Print the result to the console

**IMPORTANT**: use another variable to save the total price

### Task 2

You plan on buying some material for drawing, like pencils, pens and paper sheets.

Follow the instructions in the comments of the [task-2.js](./task-2.js) file. 

**IMPORTANT**: try to use a combination of standard operators and also the possible shorthand versions

For example:
```js
+
+=
++
```

### Task 3

You recently celebrated your birthday and your uncle gave you 10€ as a present.

You want to check if by putting together your savings, the pocket money from last week and the birthday present you just received you can afford a new video game you wanted to buy.

Instructions:

Create the following variables:
- `videoGamePrice`: the price of the video game
- `savings`: money you saved in your piggy-bank
- `pocketMoney`: pocket money your parents gave you last week
- `birthdayPresent`: the money you just received for your birthday
- `moneyTotal`: the money you have by adding together your savings, your pocket money and the birthday present

Write 3 `console.log()` to show how much money you have available, how much does the video game cost and if you can afford it.

Expected possible output:

```
I have a total of 36€
The videogame costs 59€
Can I afford to buy the videogame? false 
```

Change the values to see how the output changes.
