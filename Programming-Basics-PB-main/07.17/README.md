## Group challenge

There's a quote from a book that checks that if the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 3, then is not a prime number:

### A Gentleman in Moscow

>"Here," he said in the tone of one chipping in. "This number is not prime."
>
>Nina looked up with an expression of disbelief.
>
>"Which number?"
>
>He laid the paper in front of her and tapped a figure circled in red.
>
>"One thousand one hundred and seventy-three."
>
>"How do you know it isn't prime?"
>
>"If a number's individual digits sum to a number that is divisible by three, then it too is divisible by three."
>
>

- Create a program that sums all the individual digits of a number and then checks if it's divisible by three. 
    - Bonus: sum the digits till you only have one (example 1173: 1+1+7+3 = 12 -> 1+2 = 3)

- According to the book, if the sum of numbers is divisible by three, then it's not a prime number. Let's check the number 1173 first. 

- After that, check with other numbers and see if your program is effective with all numbers from 2 to 100. If not, create a program with your own logic.

We applied all this in [index.js](index.js) and after we created a for loop that checks all numbers to know if they are prime or not.
