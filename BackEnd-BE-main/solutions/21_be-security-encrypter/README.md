# Encrypt-Decrypt API

Your task is to create an API that users can use to encrypt and decrypt messages.

## Requirements

- Only edit `crypto.js` and `app.js`
- Your API must be able to decrypt the messages that it has encrypted
- Invent your own encryption algorithm
    - **Note:** this is not practical for the real world
    - But it is fun!
    - Maybe a combination of an algorithm like ROT-13 and character replacement?
