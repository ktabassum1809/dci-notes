# Very Bad Validation

This application contains only a user registration page. It has some validation, but... well, you'll see ðŸ¥¸.

## Tasks

The code running this application is intentionally complex. You can read it if you want, **BUT** your tasks are limited to `express` and developing the application logic.

> Before starting, don't forget to install the project dependencies!

### Task 1

Examine the file [main.js](./main.js)

1. Pay close attention to the routes
2. Test the application
3. Imagine you are reviewing the work of another student. Write down suggestions for improvement.

### Task 2

Edit the [main.js](./main.js) file. Don't edit any other file

1. Improve the validation messages so that they are more understandable
2. Validate that the `email` recevied can be used as an e-mail (it doesn't have to be a real e-mail, but it must look like one)
3. Validate the `username` so that it only allows characters fromn the English alphabet

### Task 3

How would you allow other world alphabets, such as Greek, Arabic and Korean, while maintaining security?

Feel free to think and experiment on your own, or do you own research.
