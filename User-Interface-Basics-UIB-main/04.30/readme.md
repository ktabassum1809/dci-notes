## Design: UI/UX**

- UI:

- The User Interface
    - Interface: boundary between two separate concepts/components
        - User and Computer; Human and Website
    - Websites are interfaces into information

    - What is a User Interface?
        - GUI / Graphical User Interface
        - CLI / Command Line Interface

- UX:

- UX = User Experience!
- UX refers to the overall experience of interacting with a product or system
- This includes basically everything regarding this experience
    - Visual Design
    - Usability
    - Accessibility
    - User research
    - Information architecture

- A product can look great (UI) but feel terrible to use (UX)
  
- UX is a vast field
    - It deals with the people using the target service
    - It deals with the technology powering the target service
    - It deals with the business requirements of the target service

- Someone working in UX can have many roles, for example
    - User research
        - What kind of devices do our users use
        - Where are our users located
        - How technical are our users
    - Information architecture
        - With lots of complex data, how do we it organize for intuitive use
        - How can we maintain simplicity for most use cases, but be flexible
        - On small screens, which icons should be shown and which hidden
        - On small screens, how should rarely used icons be hidden
    - Accessibility
        - Our users can have limited vision, can they use our app?
        - Our users have very bad internet, can they use our app?
        - Our chinese users can't log in with Google, how can they log in?
        - Do our users need this app in their native language
        - Do our users know how to change the language of the app
    - Usability
        - Is the user journey from "search product" to "finish ordering" smooth?
        - Does the the product crash?
        - Does the user feel listened to and helped when contacting support?
        - Do users face challenges using the product? What kind? Why?

- You could think of UX working as a pyramid, starting from the most important
    - Level 1: Functional - Does it work?
    - Level 2: Reliable - Is it available and accurate?
    - Level 3: Usable - Can it be used without difficulty?
    - Level 4: Convenient - Does it fit in with my life and work the way I want?
    - Level 5: Pleasurable - Is it an enjoyable experience thatâ€™s worth sharing?
    - Level 6: Meaningful - Does it have personal or social significance?

## Inline text semantics

- We know block semantic elements, like `header`
- There are inline semantic elements too, like `strong`, `em`
- The `span` element is like the inline version of `div`; not semantic

## Fonts

- What are fonts?
    - Different ways of drawing text
    - Basically; infinitely zoomable vector graphics

- Fonts also have a few different main categories to know
    - Monospace
    - Serif
    - Sans-serif
    - Cursive

- Each font category has TONS of options for the exact font, called font family in CSS
    - We can't know what fonts are installed on a users computer
    - But we can use a service like Google Fonts to add custom fonts to our website
    - They Download a font file kind of like a CSS file and then you can use that font

- Google Fonts might have some GDPR considerations
