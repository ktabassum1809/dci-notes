# UIB - Advanced - Animation 1:

**Last week:**

- grid (on parent & children)

**Today:**

- Animation with 'transition'
- transforming the shape of an html element using 'transform'

## Animations:

- Animations are a great tool
- Animations can
    - Help the user deal with loading times
    - Signify that something is happening
    - Call attention to elements
    - Look good!

- However, it's really easy to get animations wrong
    - Too many
    - Too fast
    - Too slow

- For fast animations like hover effects, start with a 0.3s duration
- For slow animations like background changes, start with an 8s duration
- Those seem to be good numbers in general
    - Naturally your use case might be different

- Two main ways of animating with CSS
    - Transitions
    - Custom keyframe animations

- Tomorrow we will cover keyframe animations
- Today we will cover transitions
    - Transition animations are often "reactive"
    - Meaning that the animation runs as a reaction
    - For example "Mouse goes over button, button glows"

## Wrap-up

- Animations are coool
- But don't overdo it
- Transition animations are fairly simple
- A transition = from one state to another
- For example not hovered to hovered, not focused to focused
