# Typography-Site

## Let's create a typography site and learn some more about typography in the process!

You'll find the content and its outline in the content directory. The content is essentialy some short summaries and links to useful books/articles/websites about typography.

### Tasks

- Create a nav that has internal links to the corresponding sections on the page.
- Add the image `bg.jpg` from the `img` directory as a background to the body.
- Headings should have different fonts - see the attached `style-guide`.
- Style each link's different states: `link`, `visited`, `active`, and `hover`.
- Note that links should at least change their text color on hover.
