# Practicing simple media queries

Media queries allow us to target our styles to specific screen dimensions, meaning we can tailor the visual experience depending on the viewing capabilities of a device.

## Tasks

Using the css properties `min-width` or `max-width`, change the effective CSS for the breakpoints in the following tasks.

- Work in the [main.css](/main.css) file
- The [HTML](/index.html) has already been prepared; you do not need to change it

### Task 1

- 426px - 768px: **green** border
