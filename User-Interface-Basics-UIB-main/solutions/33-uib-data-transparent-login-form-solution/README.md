# Transparent Forms

A transparent form is a popular design trend where the form elements appear to be part of the background. Now you'll get a chance to try this yourself!

## Task

Working in the files [index.html](./index.html) and [style.css](./style.css), create a form which meets the following requirements.

## Requirements

- The form should be centered in the body
- You can find the background image in [assets/background.jpg](/assets/background.jpg). The image should cover the whole body.
- A gradient should be applied over body and the background image for a darkened filter effect
- All `<input>` fields should be transparent
- The placeholder text of inputs should be bold on field selection
- Use [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons for the input fields

> Don't forget to begin your webpage with the boilerplate HTML5 code!
