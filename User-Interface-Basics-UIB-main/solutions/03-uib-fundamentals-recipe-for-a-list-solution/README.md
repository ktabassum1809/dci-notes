2½ tsp ground cinnamon
¼ fresh nutmeg
265g carrots (about 3), grated
100g sultanas or raisins
100g walnuts or pecans, roughly chopped (optional)
```

### Task 3 - The instructions

Under the `<h2>` heading **Instructions**;

1. Create a parent element for an ordered list
2. Inside this parent element, and for each of the following ingredients, create a child list item

```
Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4
Oil and line the base and sides of two 20cm cake tins with baking parchment
Whisk the oil, yogurt, eggs, vanilla and zest in a jug
Mix the flour, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg with a good pinch of salt in a bowl
Squeeze any lumps of sugar through your fingers, shaking the bowl a few times to bring the lumps to the surface
Add the wet ingredients to the dry, along with the carrots, raisins and half the nutmeg
Mix well to combine, then divide between the tins
Bake for 25-30 mins ountil a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean
If any wet mixture clings to the skewer, return to the oven for 5 mins, then check again
Leave to cool in the tins
To make the icing, beat the butter and sugar together until smooth
Add half the creamcheese and beat again, then add the rest (adding it bit by bit prevents the icing from splitting)
Remove the cakes from the tins and sandwich together with half the icing
Top with the remaining icing and scatter with the remaining walnuts
Will keep in the fridge for up to five days
Best eaten at room temperature
