# No Name People Homepage

Congratulations, you have just landed your first role! Using the materials provided, build a homepage for the "No Name People" organization!

## Task

Build a page which closely follows the design in the [mockup](/assets/NNP-mockup.png).

## Requirements

- Work in the `index.html` and `style.css` files
- All assets for the website can be found in the `/assets` folder. You can choose between using `svg` or `png` images.
- For the **header**, you should use the `logo.svg` or `logo.png` from the assets folder
- The **hero** section of your page should contain a `<button>` and the `hero.png` or `hero.svg` from the assets folder
- The **Our Services** section should contain an **unordered list** with a list of services
- Use [font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons for the **footer** section

### Design Information

| Element | color   |
| ------- | ------- |
| h1      | #000F37 |
| h2      | #000F37 |
| p       | #4F4F4F |

Font-family = [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?query=Open+Sans&selection.family=Open+Sans&sidebar.open=true)

### Changing colors in an SVG file

If you open the file [logo.svg](/assets/svg/logo.svg), you might notice that **SVG** is actually a text based format! To change the color of the image add `fill="#68e1fd"` into the root `<svg>` element just like you would add an HTML attribute, like `id="123"`
