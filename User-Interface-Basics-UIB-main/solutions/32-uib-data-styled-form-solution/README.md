# Form Styling

Let's face it - forms and their related input fields can be dull without styling! So let's create a form that enhances the experience for the user.

## Task

Working in the files [index.html](./index.html) and [style.css](./style.css), create a form which meets the following requirements. You can find all the image assets in the [/assets](/assets/) folder. Your finished result should look like the reference image below.

## Requirements

- Use `<input>` fields to collect the following information;
  - Name
  - E-mail
  - Reservation Time
- For collecting the reservation time, use the **Input type** `datetime-local`
- Use a `<label>` tag for each `<input>` field
- Include a **Submit** `<button>`
- Style your form elements using CSS
- Add a `<header>` and `<footer>` to your page
- Use the reference image below as your style guide

> Don't forget to begin your webpage with the boilerplate HTML5 code!
