# A Basic Form

We can collect data from a user with a form. Here you will create a simple order form to collect some basic personal data (name, address, etc).

## Task

Working in the files [index.html](./index.html) and [style.css](./style.css), create a form which meets the following requirements.

## Requirements

- Use `<input>` or `<textarea>` fields to collect the following information;
  - First Name
  - Last Name
  - Street
  - Zipcode
  - City
  - Phone Number
  - E-mail
  - Comments
- Use a `<label>` tag for each `<input>` or `<textarea>` field
- Use the appropriate **Input type** for each `<input>` field. For example, `email` for the **E-mail** address
- Include a **Submit** `<button>`
- Ensure the `<input>` fields appear in a single column, and not side by side
- Style your form elements using CSS
- Add a `<header>` to your page
- Use the reference image below as your style guide

> Don't forget to begin your webpage with the boilerplate HTML5 code!
