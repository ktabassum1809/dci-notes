# Typography text

This exercise is a series of typography tasks.

## What you will be doing

Work in the included HTML file and create a CSS file called `style.css`. After that complete the tasks below. Good luck!

## Tasks

### Task 1

- Choose a font on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and import using the HTML link tag
- Select different font weights e.g. light(300), regular(400), bold(700)
- Apply the font to all the elements on the page
- Underline the `<h1>` heading
- Give all list items a light _300_ font weight
- Give all headings with the class `.heading` a shadow and, in CSS, make all these elements appear uppercase
- Give the element with the class `.note` a bold font weight. Make the text appear italic.
- Strike through all the elements with the class `.todo-item`
