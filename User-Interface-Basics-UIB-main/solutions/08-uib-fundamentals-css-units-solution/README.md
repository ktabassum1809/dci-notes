# CSS units

This series of small exercises well help you practice working with various units in CSS, such as `%`, `px`, `vw`, `vh`, `em` and `rem`.

## Tasks

### Task 1

1. Create the file `index.html` and insert the basic HTML5 boilerplate code
2. Create the file `main.css`

### Task 2

1. Create a top-level heading where the font size is `12%` of the **viewport width**
2. Set the height of this element to `100%` of the viewport height. Add _just enough_ text so that it fits on one line.

Try resizing the window and observe the effect of the change.

### Task 3

1. Create a `section` element
2. Set its background color to `lightpink`
3. Set its width to `50%` of the width of its parent's content area
4. Inside this `section`, create three paragraphs with some sample text using the **emmet** abbreviation `lorem25`;
   - Set the font size of the first paragraph to `18px`
   - Set the font size of the second paragraph to `3%` of the width of the viewport
   - Set the font size of the third paragraph to `5%` of the height of the viewport

Try resizing the window and observe the effect of the change.

### Task 4

1. Create another `section` element
2. Set its background color to `lightblue`
3. Set its font size to `32px`
4. Inside this `section`, create three paragraphs with some sample text using the **emmet** abbreviation `lorem25`;;
   - Set the font size of the first paragraph to `18px`
   - Set the font size of the second paragraph to `100%` of the font size of the parent
   - Set the font size of the third paragraph to `100%` of the font size of root element

> Hint: For part 4, you may need to use `em` and `rem`

### Task 5

Create an orange box with a width equal to `80%` of the viewport width and a height equal to `50%` of the viewport height.
