# GitHub Copilot

## Steps:
- Install the extensions GitHub Copilot + GH Copilot Chat
- Go to settings (ctrl + ,), look for the keyword "autocomplete" and disable the option of autocomplete with Github
- Now you can use both the chat and `ctrl + i` to ask for commands

## Key points

- This is how Copilot can support you when learning
    - Highlight some code, then ask in the chat
        - "Explain this"
        - "What does {concept} mean"
        - "Review my code"

- Emphasize understanding the responses
    - Don't blindly trust it, it still makes mistakes
    - Over reliance on AI is bad
    - Blind copy-paste doesn't help learning

- Copilot your assistant or tutor, you are the programmer
- Copilot assists, you are the main pilot
- Some struggles are desirable
- Sometimes it's better to be slower for learning
- The solutions might be outside of our curriculum (or things that are still to come)

## What to use it and what not to use it for

**What GitHub Copilot Should Be Used For:**
GitHub Copilot can be a powerful tool for speeding up coding tasks. It can be especially helpful for:
   * Writing boilerplate code: GitHub Copilot can save you time by auto-completing common code patterns.
   * Exploring new languages or frameworks: GitHub Copilot can suggest code that follows the conventions of unfamiliar languages or frameworks.
   * Catching simple mistakes: Because GitHub Copilot's suggestions are based on successfully compiled code, they can help you avoid basic syntax errors.

**When Not to Use GitHub Copilot When Learning Web Development:**
While GitHub Copilot can be a useful tool, there are times when it's better not to use it, especially when you're learning web development:
   * When you're trying to understand fundamental concepts: GitHub Copilot can quickly provide code solutions, but this isn't always helpful when you're still trying to grasp the basics. Writing code from scratch, even if it takes longer and leads to mistakes, is a valuable part of the learning process.
   * When you're practicing problem-solving: Solving coding problems on your own is an important skill. If you rely too heavily on GitHub Copilot's suggestions, you may not develop your own problem-solving abilities.
   * When you're learning to debug: Debugging your own code is another essential skill. If GitHub Copilot prevents you from making mistakes, you won't get as much practice debugging.

Remember that while GitHub Copilot can provide code suggestions, it's ultimately your responsibility to ensure the correctness, security, and appropriateness of your code. Always review and understand any code that GitHub Copilot suggests before using it in your projects.
