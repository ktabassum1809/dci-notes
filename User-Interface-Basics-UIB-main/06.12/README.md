## General idea

In groups of 3 to 5 people, use what you have learned so far to make a project for this module.

## Requirements:

- Groups between 3 to 5 people
- Project is HTML, CSS and/or Sass
- Work on the design before development (Figma recommended)
- We encourage you to use the DCI Boilerplate
- Uses icons and fonts
- Uses flex and/or grid
- Mobile first
- Responsive
- One person per branch (git)
- Published on github pages
- Nice to have but not required: bootstrap - animation
- Presentation 5-8 minutes (Monday, 24th)
- This is not a competition! It's a way to collaborate, practice and learn
