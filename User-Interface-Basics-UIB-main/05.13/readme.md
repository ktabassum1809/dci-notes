**Last week:**

- html tables & nth child selector

**Today:**

- html forms

## Forms:

- Forms are special elements with _inputs_
- The values inserted into those inputs can be _submitted_
- They are submitted into an address as a HTTP request
    - Often a POST request
- A backend can do something the submitted values
    - Such as creating a new user
    - Or performing a database search
    - Or saving a new comment
    - Or ...

- In modern web development you don't _always_ need a classic form
    - Sometimes forms are instead just a set of inputs controlled by JavaScript
    - However, regular HTML forms make the fundamental concepts of sending data

- Before sending, forms are often _validated_
    - Submission of the form is stopped until certain criteria is met
    - Like "birth year must be a number"
    - Or "must accept terms and conditions"
    - Or "title text is mandatory"
    - Or "password must be 8 characters long"
    - When this validation happens in the browser, it's called 
        - "Client-side validation"
