# React project guidelines

## Deadline

- Thursday, 14th of Nov, presentation in the afternoon

## Requirements

- Groups of 3 to 5
- Multiple pages components (react-router-dom, preferably also sending params from one page to another)
- Nested components (preferably sending props from one to another at least once)
- Use 3rd party API to fetch some data (get request) like: weather API, recipes API...
- Deploy on render

    - Extra: 
        - One global state (`useContext`)
        - `useReducer`

- PS: you don't need to store users data (for sign up, login, profile...) since that requires a backend server and a database which we haven't learned yet.
