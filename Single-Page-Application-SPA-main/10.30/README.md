## Theory

**Recommended self-study:** 

- GitHub Actions
    - In GitHub you have these things called GitHub actions
    - They are little pieces of automation
    - Actions can run some code / perform an action for you
    - For example every time you push, it will npm run build

- It can even copy your code into other places
    - This is the simplest form of a "CI/CD" pipeline
        - Continuous Integration
        - Continuous Deployment
